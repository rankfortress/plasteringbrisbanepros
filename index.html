	Plastering is a skilled trade that plasterers can complete in new homes, extensions for existing ones and commercial property renovations. They need two coats of plaster: the first coat to make the all-important wallboard; then it’s time to mix up some top quality cement before applying another layer on as you work your way upwards.Plastering work is the process of applying plaster to your walls. It takes two coats which are applied using either a trowel or putty knife and finished with sandpaper for a smooth finish. Plasterers can also install drywall, cornice & suspended ceilings as well as installing gyprock onto new homes or extensions to existing homes.
